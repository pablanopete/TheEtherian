### Etherian.World If you're really curious, you can read our full mission statement/introductory blog post here:

[How to Centralize Information Without Centralizing Power][1]

tl;dr

We’re an Ethereum community-oriented website called <strong>The Etherian</strong>. Given the nature of distributed and decentralized systems like Ethereum, it can be difficult to get a grasp on what’s happening throughout the ecosystem at any given point in time. The problem with this uncertainty is that the status of an individual dapp or protocol feature has an amplified effect on all developers, token holders, and users. Our goal is to help bridge this gap by fostering communication, and delivering <strong>Etherians</strong> across the world all the news and resources from around the <strong>Ethereum Ecosystem</strong>.

If you somehow found your way here, but have no clue what <strong>Ethereum</strong> is - read this: [Ethereum for Everyone][2]

As you venture down the rabbit hole, please stop to say Hi at our Slack.
