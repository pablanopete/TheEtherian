    <li>Still discussing the relationship between slashing conditions, consensus, and finalization of blocks.</li>
    <li>One way Casper differs from other bft protocols:
    <blockquote>[Vitalik Buterin] or more specifically, there's no strict requirement for a block's parent to be finalized before that block can be created
    [Loi Luu] Right
    [Loi Luu] Here its different from tendermint or related bft protocols where the consensus messages can be transferred offline, and the block is only created if it has enough signatures
    [Loi Luu] So a block can be finalised at creation
    [Vitalik Buterin] right, here views and sequence numbers are interwoven</blockquote>

    <li>"1) we will have more working/complete examples for issuing claims soon 2) yes typically your app/server will have an uPort identity, 3) and we are currently working on tooling to make these app identities easy to mange."--Zach Ferland</li>
    <li>"We are are releasing a tool very shortly to allow you to create an app identity (really a uport for your app). Your approach looks correct. However you need to a uport registry entry for the app, which is what our tool basically does.
    If you can wait a week or so we should be able to get you going easily. The ropsten issues have delayed the launch of this a bit."--Pelle Braendgaard</li>
    <li>Re: using Chasqui--"the reliance on Chasqui is for UX reasons when interacting with a desktop browser. In the future we expect more and more interactions with dapps to be done through a mobile browser and/or native apps, where the Chasqui server technically is not needed."--Christian Lundkvist</li>
    <li>Still no solution to Ropsten delays, but the team is working on it.</li>
