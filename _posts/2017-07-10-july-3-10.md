<h2><strong>An Important Message on Crypto Security from MyEtherWallet!</strong></h2>
This is a reminder that *this is crypto* and *you are responsible for your safety and security*. MyEtherWallet is a _client-side wallet_, which means you hold your keys. If someone gets your private key (keystore file, mnemonic, passwords), they have complete access to your funds. There is no stopping transactions, canceling transactions, or resetting passwords.

• Never enter your private keys, passwords, sensitive data on a website that you were sent via message (right now the scams are targeting MyEtherWallet. Tomorrow it may be Kraken or Paypal)
• ONLY unlock your wallet when you want to _send a transaction_. Check your balance via https://etherscan.io/, https://ethplorer.io/
• Do not trust messages or addresses or URLs sent via private message. Always verify information w/ a secondary source.
• Always check that you are on the correct URL. (myetherwallet*.com*)
• Get a hardware wallet, like Ledger or Trezor or Keepkey or Digital Bitbox
• There is a Chrome Extension that will warn you if you attempt to navigate to a malicious site: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn
• There is the MyEtherWallet Chrome Extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/myetherwallet-cx/nlbmnnijcnlegkjjpcfjclmcfggfefdm
• You can run MEW locally and avoid the website URL situation entirely: https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-do-i-run-myetherwallet-dot-com-offline-slash-locally

More best-practices can be found here: https://myetherwallet.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/protecting-yourself-and-your-funds

Please, be careful out there.
