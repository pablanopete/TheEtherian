    <li>The existing digital advertising marketplace injures key stakeholders. The introduction of BAT allows publishers, advertisers, and users to connect in a more efficient, transparent and decentralized marketplace that reduces fraud, privacy violations, and malvertisements while increasing publisher revenue.</li>
    <li>BATs are based on user attention, which is really just focused mental engagement.</li>
    <li>BATs will be made available for crowdsale in the near future.</li>

    <blockquote>Vitalik Buterin: so I realized that the viper contract may need a bit more work basically, the challenge is this scenario you see 2/3 prepares you commit then there is a short-range fork, and in the fork 2/3 prepares don't appear until the epoch ends right now, those prepares cannot get included so you need to be able to process prepares even if they come too late at least for the purpose of evaluating slashing conditions on commits what this also implies is that you need to be able to tell at any point in the future whether or not a given validator was in a given dynasty.</blockquote>

    <li>Some good analysis:</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>@wp: This is very simplified, but 1 GNT today costs roughly $0.05. If your electricity cost = $0.20 per kwh, then electricity cost = 4 GNT/kwh. (i.e. $0.20/$0.05). Assume your electricity cost in 5 years in fiat terms won't cost much more than today, say $0.25/kwh. But let's say, hypothetically, in 5 years, GNT is double today's price. Therefore, in 5 years, electricity will cost 2.5 GNT/kwh (i.e. $0.25/$0.10). In other words, by holding GNT, you would be able to buy almost twice as much kwh of electricity in 5 years given these assumptions. There are implicit assumptions here too, but for the sake of simplicity, I omitted them. And of course, the electricity which you have purchased will be in the form of compute power.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>ryepdx: Sharding will likely make interactions within a shard cheaper than they would be on a unified blockchain (as exists now). Fees will never be entirely eliminated, but there are plans to allow contracts to pay for their own gas, which would eliminate fees for end users. (Such contracts will have to be carefully constructed, I imagine, to eliminate the possibility of being drained via "spam" invocations. Not sure what the specifics are, TBH.)</blockquote>
