    <blockquote>Vitalik Buterin: the idea for login/logout is that there are many validators who will not be able to validate 24/7, but rather want the ability to "go to sleep" for some period of time. During this time they would not contribute to the total validator set.</blockquote>

    <li>On controlling the number of validators:

    <li>Simple Stable Coin SAI soon to be released in Alpha
    <ul>
    <li>SAI (simple dai) is a CDP engine that supports a single collateral type and uses a special model for claiming the collateral which makes the system more simple and have higher liquidity, but also more reliant on the price feeds</li>
    <li>it uses an asset called SKR to represent claims to the collateral in the event of a global settlement (so it isnt like MKR at all)</li>
    <li>it will be possible to stop SAI at any time, in the event of a security issue or for other reasons, and then all SAI holders will be able to claim ETH directly at face value (unless the system is undercollateralized, in which case they get a haircut), and the leftover collateral goes to the CDP holders</li>
    <li>SKR is received when one deposits ETH into the system and can be used as collateral</li>
