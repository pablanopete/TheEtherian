    <ul>
    <li>
    <blockquote>Ad fraud is growing dramatically as no adequate solutions have appeared.The Basic Attention Token (BAT) seeks to radically reduce digital ad fraud, which is estimated to be $16B in 2017, according to a report released a few weeks ago by the World Federation of Advertisers. The sheer number of middlemen present in the ad-tech ecosystem inevitably creates entry points for fraud to flourish. Publishers do not accurately know what ads are programmatically served to their ad slots. All of this is part of what recently prompted P&amp;G’s Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard to say: “The days of giving digital a pass are over. It’s time to grow up. It’s time for action.”</blockquote>

    <li>Vitalik temporarily shifted the theme of the room to “FC17 Trollbox” to discuss other cryptoeconomic schemes being discussed at the conference.</li>
    <li>Vitalik’s conclusions (which I believe can also be applied to Dominic William’s deterministic threshold signatures):
    <ul>
    <li>
    <blockquote>“I seriously disagree with him right here because there is one piece of <em>substantial work</em> that he is asking users to do namey, stay online with the protocol as it stands I am <em>seriously</em> concerned that a whole bunch of users will be lazy, and it will frequently hit the &gt;1/3 offline threshold.”</blockquote>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Vitalik, Vlad, Karl and Loi were together at the FC17 conference in Malta this week.</li>
    <li>Potentially impactful update from Greg Meredith:
    <ul>
    <li>
    <blockquote>“My big update is that i have a proof sketch of an if and only if statement that consensus implies trace and trace implies consensus. (By trace here i mean trace in a traced monoidal category of the kind investigated by Abramsky, Haghverdi, and others.) I can now answer definitively and positively that a non-economic-based consensus can be transformed into a consensus based on slashing conditions.”</blockquote>

    </li>
    <li>SIDH is “not too useful to us”</li>
    <li>IC3 sharding research is unfortunately not a “real” sharding solution.</li>
    <li>Note to Etherian readers: Please be courteous and do not chat in this channel unless you can discuss cryptoeconomics at the academic level of the rest of the room.</li>

    <blockquote>kcchng: Hello yes things are moving, we will post an update this week. Short update currently: Chris fell sick over the weekend but he is back in force today and will provide an update on his progress on spectrum, while Anthony had to fly over to Berkeley for the Sunday workshop, dapphub guys are looking through our code.</blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
    <blockquote>kcchng: We are working with Yunbi / Gatecoin to come up with a solution where fees will remain. In a decentralized exchange it will also remain. Of course, a different exchange could try and remove the fees involved, but the act of depositing / withdrawal of tokens will also lead to txn fees. However, DGX is actually much more than just trading, it is making gold tokens useful in the ecosystem. So they will be used in payment processing (Debit card integration with Monolith, Onebit by TenX), lending and savings platforms (wetrust), ICOs (Reidao) – all these names mentioned here are active partnerships we have secured. It’ss application will be much wider than just trading, so as the ecosystem grows, dgx volume grows which will be beneficial to digixDAO.</blockquote>

    <li>On SAI (simple DAI):
    <ul>
    <li>SAI (simple dai) is a CDP engine that supports a single collateral type and uses a special model for claiming the collateral which makes the system more simple and have higher liquidity, but also more reliant on the price feeds</li>
    <li>it uses an asset called SKR to represent claims to the collateral in the event of a global settlement (so it isnt like MKR at all)</li>
    <li>it will be possible to stop SAI at any time, in the event of a security issue or for other reasons, and then all SAI holders will be able to claim ETH directly at face value (unless the system is undercollateralized, in which case they get a haircut), and the leftover collateral goes to the CDP holders</li>
    <li>SKR is received when one deposits ETH into the system and can be used as collateral</li>

It’s been policy to turn these offers down so they don’t interfere with SingularDTV’s focus of building a decentralized entertainment industry. But on very rare occasions, an entity will come along with such a great idea and whose development ladder fits in perfectly with ours, while at the same time adding substantial value to SingularDTV. In these rare cases of synchronicity we feel obligated to form partnerships. CODEX is the place where these partnerships take place.”</blockquote>
