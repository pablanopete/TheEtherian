Hi there! We’re an Ethereum community-oriented blog called <strong>The Etherian</strong>.

Given the nature of distributed and decentralized systems like Ethereum, it can be difficult to get a grasp on what’s happening throughout the ecosystem at any given point in time. The problem with this uncertainty is that the status of an individual dapp or protocol feature has an amplified effect on all developers, token holders, and users.  Our goal is to help bridge this gap by fostering communication.
